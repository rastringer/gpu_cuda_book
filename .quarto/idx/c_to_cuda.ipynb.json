If you don't know C well, don't worry, the code is straightforward with a focus on the CUDA considerations. Doing the exercises and following the examples can help with low-level understanding, which can often be abstracted away by the equivalent Python libraries.\n\n## Resources\n\nWe can do all exercises on the free `T4` GPU on Colab.\n\nLet's check we have the Nvidia CUDA Compiler Driver (NVCC) installed:\n\n## Writing and running C code in a Colab\n\nThanks to the `nvcc4jupyter` extension, we can run C/C++ code from our notebook cells.\n\nSimply annotate each code cell with `%%cuda` at the top.\n\nSyntax checking may mean a lot of read and yellow lines on our code, since it's focused on Python code, so it's best to turn this feature off:\nSettings -> Editor -> Code diagnostics -> None.\n\n## Hello, World!\n\n## and from the GPU\n\nLet's adjust the code to make it run on the GPU.\n\nWe will need to annotate functions with\n\n`__global__`\n\nand synchronize our code on the completion of the kernel using the method\n\n`cudaDeviceSynchronize();`\n\n\n## Blocks and threads\n\nYou may be wondering why we have triple angle brackets in the function call:\n\n`<<<1, 1>>>`\n\nThese are required parameters for CUDA denoting the blocks and threads in which our tasks should run.\n\n`<<< NUMBER_OF_BLOCKS, NUMBER_OF_THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>`\n\nThreads and blocks are fundamental for organizing parallel computation on GPUs. Threads are the smallest unit of action, each capable of running a single instance of the kernel function.\n\nThreads are grouped into blocks, where they can cooperate and share resources.\n\nMultiple blocks form a grid, the highest level of CUDA hierarchy.\n\n\n`kernelA <<<1, 1>>>()` runs one block with a single thread so will run only once.\n\n`kernelB <<<1, 10>>>()` runs one block with 10 threads and will run 10 times.\n\n`kernelC <<<10, 1>>>()` runs 10 thread blocks, each with a single thread so will run 10 times.\n\n`kernelD <<<10, 10>>>()` runs 10 blocks which each have 10 thread, so run 100 times.\n\nThe next example illustrates the use of threads for parallel action. Experiment with changing the `<<<blocks, threads>>>` and see the results.\n\n## Threads and indexes\n\nEach thread has an index denoting its place in a block. Blocks also are indexed, and grouped into a grid.\n\nThere are useful methods for identifying these indexes:\n\n`threadIdx.x` : identifies the index of the thread\n`blockIdx.x` : identifies the index of the block\n`blockDim.x` : represents the number of threads in a block\n\nFor example, here is a classical loop:\n\n\nWe can accelerate this operation by launching the iterations in parallel, a *multi-block loop*. Let's use two blocks of threads.\n\nHere, `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x` gives threads unique indexes in a grid.\n\n## Allocating memory\n\nCUDA version 6 and above has simplified memory allocation for both the CPU host and as or or many GPU devices with little additional work necessary by the developer.\n\nC uses calls to `malloc` and `free` to allocate and liberate memory; we simply  replace these with `cudaMallocManaged` and `cudaFree`.\n\n## Profiling\n\nLet's create an executable with the same code so we can profile and time it. To do that, we write a file using cell magic functions, compile and run.\n\n## Time it\n\n## Exercise: CUDA version\n\nLet's use `cudaMallocManaged` and `cudaFree`. Developers often prefix variables to be put on the device with `d_`, we will write `device_` to make this clear.\n\n## Solution\n\nLet's take the same approach to time our CUDA equivalent `square` function.\n\n## Grid stride\n\nLet's remind ourselves: grids are the highest level of the GPU hierarchy:\n\nThreads -> Blocks -> Grids\n\nOften in CUDA programming, the number of threads in a grid is smaller than the data upon which we operate.\n\nIf we have an array of 100 elements to do something with, and a grid of 25 threads, each grid will have to perform computation 4 times.\n\nA thread at index 20 in the grid would:\n\n* Perform its operation (eg squaring the element) on element 20 of the array\n* Increment its index by 25, the size of the grid, to 45\n* Perform its operation on element 45 of the array\n* Increment its index by 25, to 70\n* Perform its operation on element 70 of the array\n* Increment its index by 25, to 95\n* Perform its operation on element 95 of the array\n* Stop its work, since 120 is out of range for the array\n\nWe can use the CUDA variable `gridDim.x` to calculate the number of blocks in the grid. Then we calculate the number of threads in each block, using\n\n```\ngridDim.x * blockDim.x\n```\n\nHere is a grid stride loop in a kernel:\n\n```c\n__global__ void kernel(int *a, int N)\n{\n  int indexInGrid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;\n  int gridStride = gridDim.x * blockDim.x;\n\n  for (int i = indexInGrid; i < N; i += gridStride)\n  {\n    // do something to a[i];\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Exercise\n\nFor this exercise, we use the `%%writefile` magic function to create a file so we can then generate an outputs for a visualization, rather than running it inline with `%%cuda`.\n\n## Solution\n\n\n\n## Visualizing the grid stride\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"c_to_cuda.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
