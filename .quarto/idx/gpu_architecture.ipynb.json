Threads all run the same code, and an ID for each thread allows access to memory addresses and control decisions.\n\nThreads are arranged as a *grid* of *thread blocks*.\n\n## PTX\n\nPTX is a low-level, *parallel thread execution* virtual machine and instruction set architecture (ISA). In other words, it is a paradigm that leverages the GPU as a data-parallel computing device.\n\n### Programming model\n\nPTX's programming model is parallel: it specifies the execution of a given thread of a parallel thread array. A CTA, or *cooperative thread array*, is an array of threads that execute a kernel concurrently or in parallel.\n\n## SASS\n\nSASS is the low-level assembly language that compiles to binary microcode, which executes natively on NVIDIA GPUs.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rastringer/GPU_CUDA_overview/blob/main/images/gpu_arch1.png?raw=true\" width=\"1500\"/>\n\n## High level architecture\n\nGPUs have highly parallel processor architecture, comprising processing elements and memory hierarchy. Streaming processors do work on data, and that data and code are accessed from the high bandwidth memory (HMB3 in the diagram) via the L2 cache.\n\nThe A100 GPU, for example, has 108 SMs, a 40MB L2 cache, and up to 2039 GB/s bandwidth from 80GB of HBM2 memory.\n\n*NVLink Network Interconnect* enables GPU-to-GPU communication among up to 256 GPUs across multiple compute nodes.\n\n## Streaming multiprocessors\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rastringer/GPU_CUDA_overview/blob/main/images/gpu_arch2.png?raw=true\" width=\"1500\" />\n\nEach Streaming Multiprocessor has a set of execution units, a reguster file and some shared memory.\n\nWe also notice the *warp scheduler* - this is a basic unit of execution and a collection of threads. Typically these are groups of 32 threads, which are executed together by a SM.\n\n*Tensor Cores* are specialized units focused on speeding up deep learning workloads. They accel at mixed-precision matrix multiply and gradient accumulation calculations.\n\n## TeraFlops\n\nIt's worth familiarizing ourselves with TFLOPS, which stands for Trillion Floating Point Operations Per Second. This is commonly used to measure the performance of GPUs.\n\n1 TFLOP = 1 trillion floating point calculations per second (what's a floating point? Just a number with a decimal eg 1.2 or 12.3456)\n\nThe H100 with SXM% board form-factor can perform 133.8 TFLOPs on FP16 inputs.\nFP16 just means *half precision*, or 1 bit for sign (+, -), 5 bits for the exponent, and 10 bits for decimal precision. This is a very popular format for AI training and inference, since a minimal drop in accuracy also means better speed and memory efficiency.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"gpu_architecture.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
