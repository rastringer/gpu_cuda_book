In the real world, very few organizations and developers work on low-level kernel optimizations. They typically work further up the stack with frameworks such as PyTorch, leaving PyTorch's optimizations to those working on its backend (which of course uses CUDA).\n\nTo give us a lens into the operations being performed on the accelerator and their efficiency in this scenario, there are a variety of profiling tools available. In this notebook, we will explore the use of Nvidia's [Nsight](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems). The software is available as a desktop application and command line tool.  \n\n### Install Nsight tools\n\nSince Colabs are essentially a linux-based virtual machine, we can use `apt get` to install the Nvidia tools\n\n### Check the installation\n\n### Simple attention\n\nHere's our basic attention mechanism that computes query, key, and value matrices to generate weighted representations of input data.\nThe SimpleTransformer class combines this attention mechanism with layer normalization in a residual connection setup.\n\nWe will include profiling code to measure CPU and GPU performance metrics when running the model on sample input data.\n\n(Numbers will differ slightly each time we run these cells)\n\nLet's analyze the \"cuda_gpu_kern_sum\" report, which shows the GPU kernel executions:\n\n* `volta_sgemm_128x64_tn` (61.9% of GPU time):\nThis is likely the matrix multiplication for computing attention weights (q * k.transpose(-2, -1)). It's using NVIDIA's optimized GEMM (General Matrix Multiplication) kernel. Typically the most compute-intensive operation in a. transformer model.\n\n* `volta_sgemm_64x64_tn` (14.2% of GPU time):\nThis could be another part of the attention computation, possibly the final matrix multiplication with the value matrix (attn_weights * v).\n\n* `volta_sgemm_128x64_nn` (11.3% of GPU time):\nThis might be the matrix multiplication in one of the linear layers (query, key, or value projection).\n\n* `vectorized_layer_norm_kernel` (8.1% of GPU time):\nThis corresponds to the LayerNorm operation in the SimpleTransformer class.\nvectorized_elementwise_kernel (3.1% of GPU time):\nThis could be the element-wise addition in the residual connection (x + attn_output).\n\n* `softmax_warp_forward` (1.4% of GPU time):\nThis is the softmax operation applied to the attention weights.\n\nThe `SimpleAttention` class operations are primarily represented by items 1, 2, 3, and 6 in this list. These operations account for about 88.8% of the GPU kernel execution time, which indicates that the attention mechanism is indeed a significant part of the computation.\nTo optimize this, we could:\n\n* Use the optimized attention mechanism as suggested in the tutorial (torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention).\n* Experiment with different batch sizes or sequence lengths to find the optimal configuration for your hardware.\n* Consider using mixed precision (float16).\n\nLet's optimize our attention mechanism to use the `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` function, optimized for GPUs. This method uses the Flash Attention algorithm when available.\n\n(Numbers will differ slightly each time we run these cells)\n\nLooking at the \"cuda_gpu_kern_sum\" report, we notice:\n\n* volta_sgemm_128x64_tn (58.4% of GPU time, previously 61.9%):\n  * We see a slight decrease in what is likely the matrix multiplication for computing attention weights. Though small on some tiny sample data, imagine these gains multiplied exponentially on real world training and inference involving text, images, video etc.\n* volta_sgemm_64x64_tn (13.3%, previously 14.2%):\n  * Final matrix multiplication with the value matrix.\n* volta_sgemm_128x64_nn (10.6%, previously 11.3%):\n  * The linear layer matrix multiplications.\n* vectorized_layer_norm_kernel (7.7%, previously 8.1%):\n  * This corresponds to the LayerNorm operation in the SimpleTransformer class.\n* vectorized_elementwise_kernel (4.7% + 3.9% = 8.6%, previously 3.1%):\n  * This now appears as two separate kernels, possibly for different elementwise operations.\n* softmax_warp_forward (1.3%, previously 1.4%):\n  * This is still the softmax operation applied to the attention weights.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"nsight_attention.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
